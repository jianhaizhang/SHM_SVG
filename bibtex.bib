              FLAG-epitope tagged ribosomal protein L18 (FLAG-RPL18) via
              developmentally regulated promoters. The profiling of mRNAs in

              differentially expressed mRNAs in 21 cell populations defined by
              cell-specific expression of FLAG-RPL18. Phloem companion cells of
              the root and shoot had the most distinctive translatomes. When
              seedlings were exposed to a brief period of hypoxia, a pronounced
              reprioritization of mRNA enrichment in the cell-specific

              phenotypic and transcriptional events involved in the acclimation
              of the Arabidopsis thaliana seedling root to a rapid change in
              salinity. Using live-imaging analysis, we show that growth is
              dynamically regulated with a period of quiescence followed by
              recovery then homeostasis. Through the use of a new
              high-resolution spatio-temporal transcriptional map, we identify
              the key hormone signaling pathways that regulate specific
              transcriptional programs, predict their spatial domain of action,
              and link the activity of these pathways to the regulation of

              suppress the abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathway and

              regulate spatially localized transcriptional programs and promote

  title    = "{WGCNA}: an {R} package for weighted correlation network analysis",
  author   = "Langfelder, Peter and Horvath, Steve",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Correlation networks are increasingly being used in
              bioinformatics applications. For example, weighted gene
              co-expression network analysis is a systems biology method for
              describing the correlation patterns among genes across microarray
              samples. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) can be
              used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes,
              for summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an
              intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to
              external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and
              for calculating module membership measures. Correlation networks
              facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used
              to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These
              methods have been successfully applied in various biological
              contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and
              analysis of brain imaging data. While parts of the correlation
              network methodology have been described in separate publications,
              there is a need to provide a user-friendly, comprehensive, and
              consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial.
              RESULTS: The WGCNA R software package is a comprehensive
              collection of R functions for performing various aspects of
              weighted correlation network analysis. The package includes
              functions for network construction, module detection, gene
              selection, calculations of topological properties, data
              simulation, visualization, and interfacing with external
              software. Along with the R package we also present R software
              tutorials. While the methods development was motivated by gene
              expression data, the underlying data mining approach can be
              applied to a variety of different settings. CONCLUSION: The WGCNA
              package provides R functions for weighted correlation network
              analysis, e.g. co-expression network analysis of gene expression
              data. The R package along with its source code and additional
