JKD can interact with the SCR and SHR proteins implicated in root patterning, as well as another zinc finger transcription factor, MAGPIE. All of these interactions require the first zinc finger in JKD according to a Y2H assay. There are also transcriptional interactions among these proteins. The initiation of JKD transcription does not appear to depend on SCR and SHR, but later expression in the post-embryonic QC cells and ground tissue initials is reduced in scr and shr mutants. JKD also appears to be required for SCR transcription beginning in the embryo. There is also some evidence that JKD plays a role in promoting the movement of SHR into the nucleus, particularly in QC cells, but this may be indirect."

A N-terminal targeting sequence directs the THIC protein to the chloroplast stroma. A conserved TPP-binding site is located in the 3' UTR of the At2g29630.2 gene model, and is predicted to function as a riboswitch. The riboswitch controls the  formation of transcripts with alternative 3' UTR lengths, which affect mRNA accumulation and protein production. THIC transcripts are observed in seedlings 5 or more days after germination, and light promotes the expression of this gene.  Recessive mutant isolated by Redei. Leaves but not cotyledons white, lethal; restored to normal by thiamine or 2,5-dimethyl-4-aminopyrimidine."

It is a target of the ta-siRNA tasiR-ARF., ettin (ett) mutations have pleiotropic effects on Arabidopsis flower development, causing increases in perianth organ number, decreases in stamen number and anther formation, and apical-basal patterning defects in the gynoecium. The ETTIN gene encodes a protein with homology to DNA binding proteins which bind to auxin response elements. ETT transcript is expressed throughout stage 1 floral meristems and subsequently resolves to a complex pattern within petal, stamen and carpel primordia.  ETT probably functions to impart regional identity in floral meristems that affects perianth organ number spacing, stamen formation, and regional differentiation in stamens and the gynoecium. During stage 5, ETT expression appears in a ring at the top  of the floral meristem before morphological appearance of the gynoecium, consistent with the proposal that ETT is involved in prepatterning apical and basal boundaries in the gynoecium primordium.
