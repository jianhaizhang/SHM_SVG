  title    = "gganatogram: An {R} package for modular visualisation of
              anatograms and tissues based on ggplot2",
  author   = "Maag, Jesper L V",
  abstract = "Displaying data onto anatomical structures is a convenient
              technique to quickly observe tissue related information. However,
              drawing tissues is a complex task that requires both expertise in
              anatomy and the arts. While web based applications exist for
              displaying gene expression on anatograms, other non-genetic
              disciplines lack similar tools. Moreover, web based tools often
              lack the modularity associated with packages in programming
              languages, such as R. Here I present gganatogram, an R package
              used to plot modular species anatograms based on a combination of
              the graphical grammar of ggplot2 and the publicly available
              anatograms from the Expression Atlas. This combination allows for
              quick and easy, modular, and reproducible generation of
              anatograms. Using only one command and a data frame with tissue
              name, group, colour, and value, this tool enables the user to
              visualise specific human and mouse tissues with desired colours,
              grouped by a variable, or displaying a desired value, such as
              gene-expression, pharmacokinetics, or bacterial load across
              selected tissues. gganatogram consists of 5 highly annotated
              organisms, male/female human/mouse, and a cell anatogram. It
              further consists of 24 other less annotated organisms from the
              animal and plant kingdom. I hope that this tool will be useful by
              the wider community in biological sciences. Community members are
              welcome to submit additional anatograms, which can be
              incorporated into the package. A stable version gganatogram has
              been deposited to neuroconductor, and a development version can
              be found on github/jespermaag/gganatogram. An interactive shiny
              app of gganatogram can be found on
              https://jespermaag.shinyapps.io/gganatogram/, which allows for
              non-R users to create anatograms.",

  abstract = "A big challenge in current systems biology research arises when
              different types of data must be accessed from separate sources
              and visualized using separate tools. The high cognitive load
              required to navigate such a workflow is detrimental to hypothesis
              generation. Accordingly, there is a need for a robust research
              platform that incorporates all data and provides integrated
              search, analysis, and visualization features through a single
              portal. Here, we present ePlant (http://bar.utoronto.ca/eplant),
              a visual analytic tool for exploring multiple levels of
              Arabidopsis thaliana data through a zoomable user interface.
              ePlant connects to several publicly available web services to
              download genome, proteome, interactome, transcriptome, and 3D
              molecular structure data for one or more genes or gene products
              of interest. Data are displayed with a set of visualization tools
              that are presented using a conceptual hierarchy from big to
              small, and many of the tools combine information from more than
              one data type. We describe the development of ePlant in this
              article and present several examples illustrating its integrative
              features for hypothesis generation. We also describe the process
              of deploying ePlant as an ``app'' on Araport. Building on readily
              available web services, the code for ePlant is freely available

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The exploration of microarray data and data from
              other high-throughput projects for hypothesis generation has
              become a vital aspect of post-genomic research. For the
              non-bioinformatics specialist, however, many of the currently
              available tools provide overwhelming amounts of data that are
              presented in a non-intuitive way. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:
              In order to facilitate the interpretation and analysis of
              microarray data and data from other large-scale data sets, we
              have developed a tool, which we have dubbed the electronic
              Fluorescent Pictograph - or eFP - Browser, available at
              http://www.bar.utoronto.ca/, for exploring microarray and other
              data for hypothesis generation. This eFP Browser engine paints
              data from large-scale data sets onto pictographic representations
              of the experimental samples used to generate the data sets. We
              give examples of using the tool to present Arabidopsis gene
              expression data from the AtGenExpress Consortium (Arabidopsis eFP
              Browser), data for subcellular localization of Arabidopsis
              proteins (Cell eFP Browser), and mouse tissue atlas microarray
              data (Mouse eFP Browser). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The eFP
              Browser software is easily adaptable to microarray or other
              large-scale data sets from any organism and thus should prove
              useful to a wide community for visualizing and interpreting these
              data sets for hypothesis generation.",

              foci and dipeptide-repeat proteins are expected to modify RNA

              c9ALS subjects (8,224 AS and 1,437 APA), including changes in

              high-resolution spatio-temporal transcriptional map, we identify
              the key hormone signaling pathways that regulate specific

  author   = "Langfelder, Peter and Horvath, Steve",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Correlation networks are increasingly being used in
              bioinformatics applications. For example, weighted gene
              co-expression network analysis is a systems biology method for
              describing the correlation patterns among genes across microarray
              samples. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) can be
              used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes,
              for summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an
              intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to
              external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and
              for calculating module membership measures. Correlation networks
              facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used
              to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These
              methods have been successfully applied in various biological
              contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and
              analysis of brain imaging data. While parts of the correlation
              network methodology have been described in separate publications,
              there is a need to provide a user-friendly, comprehensive, and
              consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial.
              RESULTS: The WGCNA R software package is a comprehensive
              collection of R functions for performing various aspects of
              weighted correlation network analysis. The package includes
              functions for network construction, module detection, gene
              selection, calculations of topological properties, data
              simulation, visualization, and interfacing with external
              software. Along with the R package we also present R software
              tutorials. While the methods development was motivated by gene
              expression data, the underlying data mining approach can be
              applied to a variety of different settings. CONCLUSION: The WGCNA
              package provides R functions for weighted correlation network
              analysis, e.g. co-expression network analysis of gene expression
              data. The R package along with its source code and additional
              material are freely available at
