  abstract = "Plant environmental responses involve dynamic changes in growth
              and signaling, yet little is understood as to how progress
              through these events is regulated. Here, we explored the
              phenotypic and transcriptional events involved in the acclimation
              of the Arabidopsis thaliana seedling root to a rapid change in
              salinity. Using live-imaging analysis, we show that growth is
              dynamically regulated with a period of quiescence followed by
              recovery then homeostasis. Through the use of a new
              high-resolution spatio-temporal transcriptional map, we identify
              the key hormone signaling pathways that regulate specific
              transcriptional programs, predict their spatial domain of action,
              and link the activity of these pathways to the regulation of
              specific phases of growth. We use tissue-specific approaches to
              suppress the abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathway and
              demonstrate that ABA likely acts in select tissue layers to
              regulate spatially localized transcriptional programs and promote
              growth recovery. Finally, we show that salt also regulates many
              tissue-specific and time point-specific transcriptional responses
              that are expected to modify water transport, Casparian strip
              formation, and protein translation. Together, our data reveal a
              sophisticated assortment of regulatory programs acting together

  author   = "Ahn, Taejin and Lee, Eunjin and Huh, Nam and Park, Taesung",
  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Identifying altered pathways in an individual is
              important for understanding disease mechanisms and for the future
              application of custom therapeutic decisions. Existing pathway
              analysis techniques are mainly focused on discovering altered
              pathways between normal and cancer groups and are not suitable
              for identifying the pathway aberrance that may occur in an
              individual sample. A simple way to identify individual's pathway
              aberrance is to compare normal and tumor data from the same
              individual. However, the matched normal data from the same
              individual are often unavailable in clinical situation.
              Therefore, we suggest a new approach for the personalized
              identification of altered pathways, making special use of
              accumulated normal data in cases when a patient's matched normal
              data are unavailable. The philosophy behind our method is to
              quantify the aberrance of an individual sample's pathway by
              comparing it with accumulated normal samples. We propose and
              examine personalized extensions of pathway statistics,
              overrepresentation analysis and functional class scoring, to
              generate individualized pathway aberrance score. RESULTS:
              Collected microarray data of normal tissue of lung and colon
              mucosa are served as reference to investigate a number of cancer
              individuals of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and colon cancer,
              respectively. Our method concurrently captures known facts of
              cancer survival pathways and identifies the pathway aberrances
              that represent cancer differentiation status and survival. It
              also provides more improved validation rate of survival-related
              pathways than when a single cancer sample is interpreted in the
              context of cancer-only cohort. In addition, our method is useful
              in classifying unknown samples into cancer or normal groups.
              Particularly, we identified 'amino acid synthesis and
              interconversion' pathway is a good indicator of LUAD (Area Under
              the Curve (AUC) 0.982 at independent validation). Clinical
              importance of the method is providing pathway interpretation of
              single cancer, even though its matched normal data are
              unavailable. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The method was

              single-network analysis and differential network analysis.
              Single-network analysis reveals the presence of a physiologically
              interesting module that can be found in two distinct mouse

              drivers for this module. Differential network analysis reveals
              differences in connectivity and module structure between two
              networks based on the liver expression data of lean and obese

              interference (RNAi) suppressor activity of the IAV non-structural
              protein 1 (NS1), reported over a decade ago2, remains unknown3.
              Plant and insect viruses have evolved diverse virulence proteins
              to suppress RNAi as their hosts produce virus-derived small
              interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that direct specific antiviral
              defence4-7 by an RNAi mechanism dependent on the slicing activity
              of Argonaute proteins (AGOs)8,9. Recent studies have documented
              induction and suppression of antiviral RNAi in mouse embryonic
              stem cells and suckling mice10,11. However, it is still under
              debate whether infection by IAV or any other RNA virus that

              show that the biogenesis of viral siRNAs from IAV double-stranded

              human Dicer and potently suppressed by both NS1 of IAV as well as
              virion protein 35 (VP35) of Ebola and Marburg filoviruses. We
              further demonstrate that the slicing catalytic activity of AGO2

              an interferon-independent fashion. Altogether, our work shows

              within the concave face of a continuous eight-stranded
              beta-sheet, formed across the p19 homodimer interface. Direct and
              water-mediated intermolecular contacts are restricted to the
              backbone phosphates and sugar 2'-OH groups, consistent with
              sequence-independent p19-siRNA recognition. Two alpha-helical
              'reading heads' project from opposite ends of the p19 homodimer
              and position pairs of tryptophans for stacking over the terminal
              base pairs, thereby measuring and bracketing both ends of the
              siRNA duplex. Our structure provides an illustration of siRNA
              sequestering by a viral protein.",

               cells. We reported recently that nodaviral infection triggers an
               RNA silencing-based antiviral response (RSAR) in Drosophila,
               which is capable of a rapid virus clearance in the absence of
               expression of a virus-encoded suppressor. Here, we present
               further evidence to show that the Drosophila RSAR is mediated by
               the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, as the viral suppressor of
               RSAR inhibits experimental RNAi initiated by exogenous
               double-stranded RNA and RSAR requires the RNAi machinery. We
               demonstrate that RNAi also functions as a natural antiviral
               immunity in mosquito cells. We further show that vaccinia virus
               and human influenza A, B, and C viruses each encode an essential
               protein that suppresses RSAR in Drosophila. The vaccinia and
               influenza viral suppressors, E3L and NS1, are distinct
               double-stranded RNA-binding proteins and essential for
               pathogenesis by inhibiting the mammalian IFN-regulated innate
               antiviral response. We found that the double-stranded
               RNA-binding domain of NS1, implicated in innate immunity
               suppression, is both essential and sufficient for RSAR
               suppression. These findings provide evidence that mammalian
               virus proteins can inhibit RNA silencing, implicating this

              particular, this rule is followed: ``once a gap, always a gap.''
              The method has been applied to three sets of protein sequences: 7

              simple multi-seed strategy, called seed-and-vote, for mapping
              reads to a reference genome. The new strategy chooses the mapped
              genomic location for the read directly from the seeds. It uses a
              relatively large number of short seeds (called subreads)
              extracted from each read and allows all the seeds to vote on the
              optimal location. When the read length is <160 bp, overlapping
              subreads are used. More conventional alignment algorithms are
              then used to fill in detailed mismatch and indel information
              between the subreads that make up the winning voting block. The
              strategy is fast because the overall genomic location has already
              been chosen before the detailed alignment is done. It is
              sensitive because no individual subread is required to map
              exactly, nor are individual subreads constrained to map close by
              other subreads. It is accurate because the final location must be
              supported by several different subreads. The strategy extends
              easily to find exon junctions, by locating reads that contain
              sets of subreads mapping to different exons of the same gene. It

              non-bioinformatics specialist, however, many of the currently
              available tools provide overwhelming amounts of data that are
              presented in a non-intuitive way. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:
              In order to facilitate the interpretation and analysis of
              microarray data and data from other large-scale data sets, we
              have developed a tool, which we have dubbed the electronic
              Fluorescent Pictograph - or eFP - Browser, available at
              http://www.bar.utoronto.ca/, for exploring microarray and other
              data for hypothesis generation. This eFP Browser engine paints
              data from large-scale data sets onto pictographic representations
              of the experimental samples used to generate the data sets. We
              give examples of using the tool to present Arabidopsis gene

  abstract = "New sequencing technologies promise a new era in the use of DNA
              sequence. However, some of these technologies produce very short
              reads, typically of a few tens of base pairs, and to use these
              reads effectively requires new algorithms and software. In
              particular, there is a major issue in efficiently aligning short
              reads to a reference genome and handling ambiguity or lack of
              accuracy in this alignment. Here we introduce the concept of
              mapping quality, a measure of the confidence that a read actually
              comes from the position it is aligned to by the mapping
              algorithm. We describe the software MAQ that can build assemblies
              by mapping shotgun short reads to a reference genome, using
              quality scores to derive genotype calls of the consensus sequence
              of a diploid genome, e.g., from a human sample. MAQ makes full

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: We address the problem of identifying gene
              transcriptional modules from gene expression data by proposing a
              new approach. Genes mostly interact with each other to form
              transcriptional modules for context-specific cellular activities
              or functions. Unraveling such transcriptional modules is
              important for understanding biological network, deciphering
              regulatory mechanisms and identifying biomarkers. METHOD: The
              proposed algorithm is based on two-stage matrix decomposition. We
              first model microarray data as non-linear mixtures and adopt the
              non-linear independent component analysis to reduce the
              non-linear distortion and separate the data into independent
              latent components. We then apply the probabilistic sparse matrix
              decomposition approach to model the 'hidden' expression profiles
              of genes across the independent latent components as linear
              weighted combinations of a small number of transcriptional
              regulator profiles. Finally, we propose a general scheme for
              identifying gene modules from the outcomes of the matrix
              decomposition. RESULTS: The proposed algorithm partitions genes
              into non-mutually exclusive transcriptional modules, independent
              from expression profile similarity measurement. The modules
              contain genes with not only similar but different expression
              patterns, and show the highest enrichment of biological functions
              in comparison with those by other methods. The usefulness of the

               reprogramming, which is central to plant survival. Although
               substantial knowledge has accumulated on how a few plant
               cis-regulatory elements (CREs) function in stress regulation,
               many more CREs remain to be discovered. In addition, the plant
               stress cis-regulatory code, i.e., how CREs work independently
               and/or in concert to specify stress-responsive transcription, is
               mostly unknown. On the basis of gene expression patterns under
               multiple stresses, we identified a large number of putative CREs
               (pCREs) in Arabidopsis thaliana with characteristics of
               authentic cis-elements. Surprisingly, biotic and abiotic
               responses are mostly mediated by two distinct pCRE
               superfamilies. In addition, we uncovered cis-regulatory codes
               specifying how pCRE presence and absence, combinatorial
               relationships, location, and copy number can be used to predict
               stress-responsive expression. Expression prediction models based
               on pCRE combinations perform significantly better than those
               based on simply pCRE presence and absence, location, and copy
               number. Furthermore, instead of a few master combinatorial rules
               for each stress condition, many rules were discovered, and each
               appears to control only a small subset of stress-responsive
               genes. Given there are very few documented interactions between
               plant CREs, the combinatorial rules we have uncovered
               significantly contribute to a better understanding of the

  abstract = "Protein expression profiling is defined in general as identifying
              the proteins expressed in a particular tissue, under a specified
              set of conditions and at a particular time, usually compared to
              expression in reference samples. This information is useful in
              drug discovery and diagnosis as well as in understanding response
              mechanisms at the protein level. We may identify all the proteins
              responding to a particular stimulus and select those whose
              expression changes most. Or we may isolate significant protein
              variables and then identify them. These definitive sets of
              proteins (protein expression signatures; PES) are specific to
              diseases, toxicants, physical stresses, and to degrees of stress
              severity. Here we describe a method, based on machine learning,
              for isolating the sets of proteins, before identifying them by
              name, which classify accurately the treatment classes in a study.
              The principle in this chapter is that if proteins associated with
              known classes of interest can be used to identify unknown classes
              then the proteins are definitive for diagnosis.The proteins in
              each class, including controls, are converted to digital data and
              serve as input to artificial neural network (ANN) models.
              Multiple two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE) gel patterns are
              included in each treatment class. A training subset of digitized
              individual, not composite, gel images is used to construct an ANN
              model which is then applied to a test set of images. Successful
              classification of the unknown (test) data confirms that the
              variables included in the model are indeed significant in
              discrimination among the classes. In the study described here the
              misclassifications were 5\% or less using the ANN models. The ANN
              method seems to be a useful complement to image analysis,
              described in Chapter ``Troubleshooting Image Analysis in 2DE''.

               few properties that seem to be common to many networks: the

               descriptions of interactomes and their comparative analysis is
               fundamental to a deeper understanding of biological processes. A
               first step in such an analysis is to align two or more PPI
               networks. Here, we introduce an algorithm, IsoRank, for global
               alignment of multiple PPI networks. The guiding intuition here
               is that a protein in one PPI network is a good match for a
               protein in another network if their respective sequences and
               neighborhood topologies are a good match. We encode this
               intuition as an eigenvalue problem in a manner analogous to
               Google9s PageRank method. Using IsoRank, we compute a global
               alignment of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila
               melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Mus musculus, and Homo
               sapiens PPI networks. We demonstrate that incorporating PPI data

               been effective at identifying conserved, localized network
               patterns across pairs of networks. This work takes the further
               step of performing a global alignment of multiple PPI networks.
               It simultaneously uses sequence similarity and network data and,
               unlike previous approaches, explicitly models the tradeoff
               inherent in combining them. We expect IsoRank---with its

              how these data respond to differential expression analysis. In
              this work, we set out to gain insights into the characteristics
              of RNA-seq data analysis by studying an important parameter of
              this technology: the sequencing depth. We have analyzed how
              sequencing depth affects the detection of transcripts and their

              such as transcript biotype, length, expression level, and

              this results in a considerable number of false positives that

              method models the noise distribution from the actual data, can
              therefore better adapt to the size of the data set, and is more
              effective in controlling the rate of false discoveries. This work

              biological processes for which the expression behavior is
              conserved over different species. However, comparing module
              networks across species is not trivial. The definition of a

              the distance threshold that defines the degree of coexpression
              gives rise to different modules. As a result when comparing
              modules across species, many different partially overlapping
              conserved module pairs across species exist and deciding which
              pair is most relevant is hard. Therefore, we developed a method
              referred to as conserved modules across organisms (COMODO) that

              While the fact that sequence similarity implies functional
              similarity is a fundamental paradigm of molecular biology,
              sequence comparison does not directly assess the extent to which

              has limited utility for analyzing families with several

              provide a cross-organism functional similarity measure in an
              unbiased way through the exclusive use of high-throughput

              adopted, a first one relying on hybridization techniques such as
              microarrays, and a second one based on sequencing techniques such
              as serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE), cDNA-AFLP, and
              analysis based on expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Despite both
              types of profiling experiments becoming routine techniques in

              laborious. As a result, the number of conditions profiled in

              from only two to few hundreds of samples for the largest

               genome-wide comparative analysis thus far has been based
               primarily on genomic sequence information. We present a
               comparative study of large datasets of expression profiles from
               six evolutionarily distant organisms: S. cerevisiae, C. elegans,
               E. coli, A. thaliana, D. melanogaster, and H. sapiens. We use
               genomic sequence information to connect these data and compare
               global and modular properties of the transcription programs.
               Linking genes whose expression profiles are similar, we find
               that for all organisms the connectivity distribution follows a
               power-law, highly connected genes tend to be essential and
               conserved, and the expression program is highly modular. We
               reveal the modular structure by decomposing each set of
               expression data into coexpressed modules. Functionally related
               sets of genes are frequently coexpressed in multiple organisms.

              such as healthy and disease, to identify key players in the
              discriminating biological processes. In contrast to conventional
              differential analysis, DiNA identifies changes in the interplay
              between molecules, rather than changes in single molecules. This
              ability is especially important in cases where effectors are
              changed, e.g. mutated, but their expression is not. A number of
              different DiNA approaches have been proposed, yet a comparative
              assessment of their performance in different settings is still
              lacking. In this paper, we evaluate 10 different DiNA algorithms
              regarding their ability to recover genetic key players from
              transcriptome data. We construct high-quality regulatory networks

              global algorithms, and that all DiNA algorithms outperform
              conventional differential expression analysis. We also assess the

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Analogous to biological sequence comparison,
              comparing cellular networks is an important problem that could
              provide insight into biological understanding and therapeutics.
              For technical reasons, comparing large networks is
              computationally infeasible, and thus heuristics, such as the
              degree distribution, clustering coefficient, diameter, and
              relative graphlet frequency distribution have been sought. It is
              easy to demonstrate that two networks are different by simply
              showing a short list of properties in which they differ. It is
              much harder to show that two networks are similar, as it requires
              demonstrating their similarity in all of their exponentially many
              properties. Clearly, it is computationally prohibitive to analyze
              all network properties, but the larger the number of constraints
              we impose in determining network similarity, the more likely it
              is that the networks will truly be similar. RESULTS: We introduce
              a new systematic measure of a network's local structure that
              imposes a large number of similarity constraints on networks
              being compared. In particular, we generalize the degree
              distribution, which measures the number of nodes 'touching' k
              edges, into distributions measuring the number of nodes
              'touching' k graphlets, where graphlets are small connected
              non-isomorphic subgraphs of a large network. Our new measure of
              network local structure consists of 73 graphlet degree
              distributions of graphlets with 2-5 nodes, but it is easily
              extendible to a greater number of constraints (i.e. graphlets),
              if necessary, and the extensions are limited only by the
              available CPU. Furthermore, we show a way to combine the 73
              graphlet degree distributions into a network 'agreement' measure
              which is a number between 0 and 1, where 1 means that networks
              have identical distributions and 0 means that they are far apart.
              Based on this new network agreement measure, we show that almost
              all of the 14 eukaryotic PPI networks, including human, resulting
              from various high-throughput experimental techniques, as well as

               independent of TF expression level, are overlooked by
               differential expression analysis. Using bovine Piedmontese

              studies of other mRNA populations, such as mRNAs in translation
              complexes (polysomes). The aim of this study was to evaluate the
              role of translational regulation in response to oxygen
              deprivation (hypoxia). METHODS: Alterations in total cellular and
              large polysome (>or=five ribosomes per mRNA) mRNA levels were
              monitored in response to 12 h of hypoxia stress in seedlings of
              Arabidopsis thaliana with a full-genome oligonucleotide
              microarray. KEY RESULTS: Comparison of two mRNA populations
              revealed considerable modulation of mRNA accumulation and
              diversity in translation in response to hypoxia. Consistent with
              the global decrease in protein synthesis, hypoxia reduced the
              average proportion of individual mRNA species in large polysome
              complexes from 56.1\% to 32.1\%. A significant decrease in the
              association with translational complexes was observed for 77\% of
              the mRNAs, including a subset of known hypoxia-induced gene
              transcripts. The examination of mRNA levels of nine genes in
              polysomes fractionated through sucrose density gradients
              corroborated the microarray data. Gene cluster analysis was used
              to identify mRNAs that displayed co-ordinated regulation. Fewer
              than half of the highly induced mRNAs circumvented the global
              depression of translation. Moreover, a large number of mRNAs
              displayed a significant decrease in polysome association without
              a concomitant decrease in steady-state accumulation. The abundant
              mRNAs that encode the ribosomal proteins behaved in this manner.
              By contrast, a small group of abiotic and biotic stress-induced
              mRNAs showed a significant increase in polysome association,
              without a change in abundance. Evaluation of quantitative
              features of mRNA sequences demonstrated that a low GC nucleotide
              content of the 5'-untranslated region provides a selective
              advantage for translation under hypoxia. CONCLUSIONS: Alterations
              in transcript abundance and translation contribute to the
              differential regulation of gene expression in response to oxygen

              expression. We tested these ideas by analyzing light- and
              plastid-regulated transcriptomes in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis
              thaliana). We found that the enrichment of Gene Ontology terms in
              these transcriptomes is consistent with the integration of light
              and plastid signaling (1) down-regulating photosynthesis and
              inducing both repair and stress tolerance in dysfunctional
              chloroplasts and (2) helping coordinate processes such as growth,
              the circadian rhythm, and stress responses with the degree of
              chloroplast function. We then tested whether factors that
              contribute to this signal integration are also regulated by light
              and plastid signals by characterizing T-DNA insertion alleles of
              genes that are regulated by light and plastid signaling and that

               is a critical component in a developmental pathway regulating

               differentiation potential of a subset of stem cells in the
               Arabidopsis root. To obtain a comprehensive view of the SHR
               pathway, we used a statistical method called meta-analysis to
               combine the results of several microarray experiments measuring
               the changes in global expression profiles after modulating SHR
               activity. Meta-analysis was first used to identify the direct
               targets of SHR by combining results from an inducible form of
               SHR driven by its endogenous promoter, ectopic expression,
               followed by cell sorting and comparisons of mutant to wild-type
               roots. Eight putative direct targets of SHR were identified, all
               with expression patterns encompassing subsets of the native SHR
               expression domain. Further evidence for direct regulation by SHR
               came from binding of SHR in vivo to the promoter regions of four
               of the eight putative targets. A new role for SHR in the
               vascular cylinder was predicted from the expression pattern of
               several direct targets and confirmed with independent markers.
               The meta-analysis approach was then used to perform a global
               survey of the SHR indirect targets. Our analysis suggests that
               the SHR pathway regulates root development not only through a
               large transcription regulatory network but also through hormonal
               pathways and signaling pathways using receptor-like kinases.
               Taken together, our results not only identify the first nodes in
               the SHR pathway and a new function for SHR in the development of
               the vascular tissue but also reveal the global architecture of
               this developmental pathway.",

              counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different

              package for examining differential expression of replicated count
              data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both
              biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are
              used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts,
              improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be
              used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided
              at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated.

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: A genetic interaction refers to the deviation of
              phenotypes from the expected when perturbing two genes
              simultaneously. Studying genetic interactions help clarify
              relationships between genes, such as compensation and masking,
              and identify gene groups of functional modules. Recently, several
              genome-scale experiments for measuring quantitative (positive and
              negative) genetic interactions have been conducted. The results
              revealed that genes in the same module usually interact with each
              other in a consistent way (pure positive or negative); this
              phenomenon was designated as monochromaticity. Monochromaticity
              might be the underlying principle that can be utilized to unveil
              the modularity of cellular networks. However, no appropriate
              quantitative measurement for this phenomenon has been proposed.
              RESULTS: In this study, we propose the monochromatic index (MCI),
              which is able to quantitatively evaluate the monochromaticity of
              potential functional modules of genes, and the MCI was used to
              study genetic landscapes in different cellular subsystems. We
              demonstrated that MCI not only amend the deficiencies of MP-score
              but also properly incorporate the background effect. The results
              showed that not only within-complex but also between-complex
              connections present significant monochromatic tendency.
              Furthermore, we also found that significantly higher proportion
              of protein complexes are connected by negative genetic
              interactions in metabolic network, while transcription and
              translation system adopts relatively even number of positive and
              negative genetic interactions to link protein complexes.
              CONCLUSION: In summary, we demonstrate that MCI improves
              deficiencies suffered by MP-score, and can be used to evaluate
              monochromaticity in a quantitative manner. In addition, it also
              helps to unveil features of genetic landscapes in different
              cellular subsystems. Moreover, MCI can be easily applied to data
              produced by different types of genetic interaction methodologies
              such as Synthetic Genetic Array (SGA), and epistatic miniarray

               transcriptome approach to define and organize a large set of
               genes into a transcriptional regulatory network. Using cell fate

               together with fluorescence-activated cell-sorting to
               preferentially analyze the root epidermis transcriptome, we
               identified 1,582 genes differentially expressed in the root-hair
               or non-hair cell types, including a set of 208 ``core'' root
               epidermal genes. The organization of the core genes into a
               network was accomplished by using 17 distinct root epidermis
               mutants and 2 hormone treatments to perturb the system and
               assess the effects on each gene's transcript accumulation. In
               addition, temporal gene expression information from a
               developmental time series dataset and predicted gene
               associations derived from a Bayesian modeling approach were used
               to aid the positioning of genes within the network. Further, a

               within the network, including MYC1, bHLH54, bHLH66, and bHLH82,

               analyses provides a new view of the composition, architecture,
               and logic of the root epidermal transcriptional network, and it

              Despite the importance of BRs in plant biology, the signal that
              initiates BR biosynthesis remains unknown. Among the enzymes
              involved in BR biosynthesis in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis
              thaliana), DWARF4 catalyzes the rate-determining step. Through
              both the histochemical analysis of DWF4pro:GUS plants and the
              direct measurement of endogenous BR content, we discovered that
              BR biosynthesis is stimulated by auxin. When DWF4pro:GUS was
              subjected to auxin dose-response tests and a time-course
              analysis, GUS activity started to increase at an auxin
              concentration of 10 nm, rising noticeably after 1 h of auxin
              treatment. In addition, the analysis of the DWF4pro:GUS line in
              BR- and auxin-mutant backgrounds revealed that the induction by
              auxin requires auxin-signaling pathways but not BRs, which
              implies that auxin signaling directly controls BR biosynthesis.
              Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that
              auxin inhibits the binding of the transcriptional repressor,
              BZR1, to the DWF4 promoter. A microarray analysis that was
              designed to examine the transcriptomes after treatment with auxin
              alone or auxin plus brassinazole (a BR biosynthetic inhibitor)
              revealed that genes previously characterized as being auxin
              responsive are not properly regulated when BR biosynthesis is
              disrupted by brassinazole. Therefore, our results support the
              idea that auxin regulates BR biosynthesis, and that auxin thus
              relies on synthesized BRs for some of its growth-promoting
              effects in Arabidopsis.",

               evidence for functional diversity among individual RTs. Of the

               of transcripts associated with phytohormones and secondary cell
               wall (SCW) metabolism, whereas lateral RTs showed a greater
               accumulation of transcripts related to mineral transport. In
               nature, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis represents the

               Unlike model plant Arabidopsis, the molecular basis of such

              phosphate content in soil, while the other conferred a tolerance
              to drought by controlling root gravitropism, resulting in root
              system expansion deep in the soil. Findings based on the
              higher-resolution QTL detection offered by the development of

              another GRAS transcription factor, SCARECROW-LIKE 23 (SCL23), the

              complexes with its upstream regulator SHR. In turn, the SHR-SCL23
              heterodimers bind to the SCL23 promoter, resulting in activation
              of SCL23 expression, which is reminiscent of the relationship
              between SHR and SCR. In addition, genetic analyses revealed that
              any mutant combination with shr displayed phenotypes nearly
              identical to those of shr in both root and shoot. Thus, it is
              likely that SHR acts as a master regulator in the SHR-SCR-SCL23

               tissues of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and the expression
               of genes encoding core enzymes for starch synthesis. Starch is
               accumulated in plastids of epidermal, mesophyll, vascular, and
               root cap cells but not in root proper cells. We also identify
               cells that can synthesize starch heterotrophically in albino
               mutants. Starch synthesis in leaves is regulated by
               developmental stage and light. Expression of gene
               promoter-$\beta$-glucuronidase fusion constructs in transgenic
               seedlings shows that starch synthesis genes are
               transcriptionally active in cells with starch synthesis and are

              robustness of the underlying metabolic network. Complex
              communication networks display a surprising degree of robustness:
              although key components regularly malfunction, local failures

              organizing and interpreting results and for relating expression
              patterns across different experiments. Existing methods are based
              on permutation. Methods that rely on permutation of probes
              unrealistically assume independence of genes, while those that
              rely on permutation of sample are suitable only for two-group
              comparisons with a good number of replicates in each group.
              RESULTS: We present ROAST, a statistically rigorous gene set test
              that allows for gene-wise correlation while being applicable to
              almost any experimental design. Instead of permutation, ROAST
              uses rotation, a Monte Carlo technology for multivariate
              regression. Since the number of rotations does not depend on
              sample size, ROAST gives useful results even for experiments with
              minimal replication. ROAST allows for any experimental design
              that can be expressed as a linear model, and can also incorporate
              array weights and correlated samples. ROAST can be tuned for
              situations in which only a subset of the genes in the set are
              actively involved in the molecular pathway. ROAST can test for
              uni- or bi-direction regulation. Probes can also be weighted to
              allow for prior importance. The power and size of the ROAST
              procedure is demonstrated in a simulation study, and compared to
              that of a representative permutation method. Finally, ROAST is

              human and mouse mammary stems. AVAILABILITY: ROAST is implemented

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Peroxiredoxins (PRXs) have recently been identified
              as plant antioxidants. Completion of various genome sequencing
              projects has provided genome-wide information about PRX genes in
              major plant species. Two of these -- Oryza sativa (rice) and
              Arabidopsis -- each have 10 PRX members. Although significant
              progress has been made in understanding their biological roles in
              Arabidopsis, those functions in rice, a model crop plant, have
              not been well studied. RESULTS: We performed a comparative
              expression analysis of rice and Arabidopsis PRXs. Our
              phylogenetic analysis revealed that one subgroup contains three
              rice and three Arabidopsis Type-II PRXs that are expressed
              ubiquitously. This suggests that they are involved in
              housekeeping functions to process reactive oxygen species (ROS).
              Within the second subgroup, expression of Os1-CysPrxA
              (LOC\_Os7g44430) and AtOs1-CysPrx is conserved in seeds while
              Os1-CysPrxB (LOC\_Os7g44440) shows a root-preferential pattern of
              expression. We used transgenic plants expressing the GUS reporter
              gene under the control of the promoters of these two tandem
              duplicates to confirm their meta-expression patterns. Our GUS
              expression data from developing seeds and those that were
              germinating indicated that Os1-CysPrxB is involved in root
              development, as initiated from the embryo, while Os1-CysPrxA has
              roles in regulating endosperm development near the aleurone
              layer. For the third and fourth subgroups, the rice PRXs are more
              likely to show leaf/shoot-preferential expression, while those
              from Arabidopsis are significantly expressed in the flowers and
              seeds in addition to the leaf/shoot. To determine the biological
              meaning of those expression patterns that were dominantly
              identified in rice PRXs, we analyzed three rice genes showing
              leaf/shoot-preferential expression in a mutant of the
              light-responsive 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase
              (dxr) gene and found that two of them were significantly
              down-regulated in the mutant. CONCLUSION: A global expression
              analysis of the PRX family in rice identified tandem duplicates,
              Os1-CysPrxA and Os1-CysPrxB, in the 1-CysPrx subgroup that are
              differentially expressed in developing seeds and germinating
              seeds. Analysis of the cis-acting regulatory elements (CREs)
              revealed unique CREs responsible for embryo and root or
              endosperm-preferential expression. In addition, the presence of
              leaf/shoot-preferential PRXs in rice suggests that they are
              required in that crop because those plants must tolerate a higher
              light intensity in their normal growth environment when compared
              with that of Arabidopsis. Downregulation of two PRXs in the dxr
              mutant causing an albino phenotype, implying that those genes
              have roles in processing ROS produced during photosynthesis.
              Network analysis of four PRXs allowed us to model regulatory
              pathways that explain the underlying protein interaction network.

              it possible to define correlated gene expression patterns within
              one species and to study how expression has evolved between
              species. We developed a robust framework to measure expression
              context conservation (ECC) and found, by analyzing 4,630 pairs of
              orthologous Arabidopsis and rice genes, that 77\% showed
              conserved coexpression. Examples of nonconserved ECC categories
              suggested a link between regulatory evolution and environmental
              adaptations and included genes involved in signal transduction,
              response to different abiotic stresses, and hormone stimuli. To
              identify genomic features that influence expression evolution, we
              analyzed the relationship between ECC, tissue specificity, and
              protein evolution. Tissue-specific genes showed higher expression
              conservation compared with broadly expressed genes but were fast
              evolving at the protein level. No significant correlation was
              found between protein and expression evolution, implying that
              both modes of gene evolution are not strongly coupled in plants.
              By integration of cis-regulatory elements, many ECC conserved
              genes were significantly enriched for shared DNA motifs, hinting
              at the conservation of ancestral regulatory interactions in both
              model species. Surprisingly, for several tissue-specific genes,
              patterns of concerted network evolution were observed, unveiling
              conserved coexpression in the absence of conservation of tissue
              specificity. These findings demonstrate that orthologs inferred
              through sequence similarity in many cases do not share similar
              biological functions and highlight the importance of

              understanding normal cell physiology and complex pathologic
              phenotypes. Existing computational methods for the genome-wide
              ``reverse engineering'' of such networks have been successful
              only for lower eukaryotes with simple genomes. Here we present
              ARACNE, a novel algorithm, using microarray expression profiles,
              specifically designed to scale up to the complexity of regulatory
              networks in mammalian cells, yet general enough to address a
              wider range of network deconvolution problems. This method uses
              an information theoretic approach to eliminate the majority of
              indirect interactions inferred by co-expression methods. RESULTS:
              We prove that ARACNE reconstructs the network exactly
              (asymptotically) if the effect of loops in the network topology
              is negligible, and we show that the algorithm works well in
              practice, even in the presence of numerous loops and complex
              topologies. We assess ARACNE's ability to reconstruct
              transcriptional regulatory networks using both a realistic
              synthetic dataset and a microarray dataset from human B cells. On
              synthetic datasets ARACNE achieves very low error rates and
              outperforms established methods, such as Relevance Networks and
              Bayesian Networks. Application to the deconvolution of genetic
              networks in human B cells demonstrates ARACNE's ability to infer
              validated transcriptional targets of the cMYC proto-oncogene. We
              also study the effects of misestimation of mutual information on
              network reconstruction, and show that algorithms based on mutual
              information ranking are more resilient to estimation errors.
              CONCLUSION: ARACNE shows promise in identifying direct
              transcriptional interactions in mammalian cellular networks, a
              problem that has challenged existing reverse engineering
              algorithms. This approach should enhance our ability to use
              microarray data to elucidate functional mechanisms that underlie
              cellular processes and to identify molecular targets of
              pharmacological compounds in mammalian cellular networks.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The use of correlation networks is widespread in the
              analysis of gene expression and proteomics data, even though it
              is known that correlations not only confound direct and indirect
              associations but also provide no means to distinguish between
              cause and effect. For ``causal'' analysis typically the inference
              of a directed graphical model is required. However, this is
              rather difficult due to the curse of dimensionality. RESULTS: We
              propose a simple heuristic for the statistical learning of a
              high-dimensional ``causal'' network. The method first converts a
              correlation network into a partial correlation graph.
              Subsequently, a partial ordering of the nodes is established by
              multiple testing of the log-ratio of standardized partial
              variances. This allows identifying a directed acyclic causal
              network as a subgraph of the partial correlation network. We
              illustrate the approach by analyzing a large Arabidopsis thaliana
              expression data set. CONCLUSION: The proposed approach is a
              heuristic algorithm that is based on a number of approximations,
              such as substituting lower order partial correlations by full
              order partial correlations. Nevertheless, for small samples and
              for sparse networks the algorithm not only yield sensible first
              order approximations of the causal structure in high-dimensional
              genomic data but is also computationally highly efficient.
              AVAILABILITY AND REQUIREMENTS: The method is implemented in the

              these data is especially important for network-based approaches

              within a network. The two GCN construction methods used were,
              Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) and Partial
              Correlation and Information Theory (PCIT) methods. Nodes were
              ranked based on their connectivity measures in each of the four
              different networks created by WGCNA and PCIT and node ranks in

               validating their architectural characteristics based on
               innovative computational methods beyond function enrichment and
               biological validation. To display the framework progress in this
               domain, we systematically divided the existing Computational
               Validation Approaches based on Modular Architecture (CVAMA) into
               topology-based approaches (TBA) and statistics-based approaches
               (SBA). We compared the available module validation methods based
               on 11 gene expression datasets, and partially consistent results
               in the form of homogeneous models were obtained with each
               individual approach, whereas discrepant contradictory results
               were found between TBA and SBA. The TBA of the Zsummary value
               had a higher Validation Success Ratio (VSR) (51\%) and a higher
               Fluctuation Ratio (FR) (80.92\%), whereas the SBA of the
               approximately unbiased (AU) p-value had a lower VSR (12.3\%) and
               a lower FR (45.84\%). The Gray area simulated study revealed a
               consistent result for these two models and indicated a lower
               Variation Ratio (VR) (8.10\%) of TBA at 6 simulated levels.
               Despite facing many novel challenges and evidence limitations,
               CVAMA may offer novel insights into modular networks.",

              whose function is unknown and are further used in studies of
              translational functional genomics among species. In this work, a
              methodology for the reconstruction and comparison of GCNs is
              presented. This approach was applied using gene expression data
              that were obtained from immunity experiments in Arabidopsis
              thaliana, rice, soybean, tomato and cassava. After the evaluation
              of diverse similarity metrics for the GCN reconstruction, we
              recommended the mutual information coefficient measurement and a
              clustering coefficient-based method for similarity threshold
              selection. To compare GCNs, we proposed a multivariate approach
              based on the Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Branches of
              plant immunity that were exemplified by each experiment were
              analyzed in conjunction with the PCA results, suggesting both the
              robustness and the dynamic nature of the cellular responses. The
              dynamic of molecular plant responses produced networks with

              showed that in response to similar pathogens plants could
              activate conserved signaling pathways. The results confirmed that
              the closeness of GCNs projected on the principal component space
              is an indicative of similarity among GCNs. This also can be used

              in which a P-value is assigned to a set of genes as a unit. Gene
              set tests are valuable for increasing statistical power,
              organizing and interpreting results and for relating expression
              patterns across different experiments. Existing methods are based
              on permutation. Methods that rely on permutation of probes
              unrealistically assume independence of genes, while those that
              rely on permutation of sample are suitable only for two-group
              comparisons with a good number of replicates in each group.
              RESULTS: We present ROAST, a statistically rigorous gene set test
              that allows for gene-wise correlation while being applicable to
              almost any experimental design. Instead of permutation, ROAST
              uses rotation, a Monte Carlo technology for multivariate
              regression. Since the number of rotations does not depend on
              sample size, ROAST gives useful results even for experiments with
              minimal replication. ROAST allows for any experimental design
              that can be expressed as a linear model, and can also incorporate
              array weights and correlated samples. ROAST can be tuned for
              situations in which only a subset of the genes in the set are
              actively involved in the molecular pathway. ROAST can test for
              uni- or bi-direction regulation. Probes can also be weighted to
              allow for prior importance. The power and size of the ROAST
              procedure is demonstrated in a simulation study, and compared to
              that of a representative permutation method. Finally, ROAST is
              used to test the degree of transcriptional conservation between
              human and mouse mammary stems. AVAILABILITY: ROAST is implemented

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Affymetrix GeneChip technology enables the parallel
              observations of tens of thousands of genes. It is important that
              the probe set annotations are reliable so that biological
              inferences can be made about genes which undergo differential
              expression. Probe sets representing the same gene might be
              expected to show similar fold changes/z-scores, however this is
              in fact not the case. RESULTS: We have made a case study of the
              mouse Surf4, chosen because it is a gene that was reported to be
              represented by the same eight probe sets on the MOE430A array by
              both Affymetrix and Bioconductor in early 2004. Only five of the
              probe sets actually detect Surf4 transcripts. Two of the probe
              sets detect splice variants of Surf2. We have also studied the
              expression changes of the eight probe sets in a public-domain
              microarray experiment. The transcripts for Surf4 are correlated
              in time, and similarly the transcripts for Surf2 are also
              correlated in time. However, the transcripts for Surf4 and Surf2
              are not correlated. This proof of principle shows that
              observations of expression can be used to confirm, or otherwise,
              annotation discrepancies. We have also investigated groups of
              probe sets on the RAE230A array that are assigned to the same
              LocusID, but which show large variances in differential
              expression in any one of three different experiments on rat. The
              probe set groups with high variances are found to represent cases
              of alternative splicing, use of alternative poly(A) signals, or
              incorrect annotations. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that some
              probe sets should not be considered as unique measures of
              transcription, because the individual probes map to more than one
              transcript dependent upon the biological condition. Our results
              highlight the need for care when assessing whether groups of
              probe sets all measure the same transcript.",

               in studying whether modules are preserved across multiple
               networks. For example, to determine whether a pathway of genes
               is perturbed in a certain condition, one can study whether its
               connectivity pattern is no longer preserved. Non-preserved
               modules can either be biologically uninteresting (e.g.,
               reflecting data outliers) or interesting (e.g., reflecting sex
               specific modules). An intuitive approach for studying module
               preservation is to cross-tabulate module membership. But this
               approach often cannot address questions about the preservation
               of connectivity patterns between nodes. Thus, cross-tabulation

               of a network module are preserved. Cross-tabulation methods make
               it difficult to argue that a module is not preserved. The weak
               statement (``the reference module does not overlap with any of
               the identified test set modules'') is less relevant in practice
               than the strong statement (``the module cannot be found in the
               test network irrespective of the parameter settings of the
               module detection procedure''). Module preservation statistics
               have important applications, e.g. we show that the wiring of
               apoptosis genes in a human cortical network differs from that in
               chimpanzees.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Many gene expression normalization algorithms exist
              for Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays. The most popular of these is
              RMA, primarily due to the precision and low noise produced during
              the process. A significant strength of this and similar
              approaches is the use of the entire set of arrays during both
              normalization and model-based estimation of signal. However, this
              leads to differing estimates of expression based on the starting
              set of arrays, and estimates can change when a single, additional
              chip is added to the set. Additionally, outlier chips can impact
              the signals of other arrays, and can themselves be skewed by the
              majority of the population. RESULTS: We developed an approach,
              termed IRON, which uses the best-performing techniques from each
              of several popular processing methods while retaining the ability
              to incrementally renormalize data without altering previously
              normalized expression. This combination of approaches results in
              a method that performs comparably to existing approaches on
              artificial benchmark datasets (i.e. spike-in) and demonstrates
              promising improvements in segregating true signals within
              biologically complex experiments. CONCLUSIONS: By combining
              approaches from existing normalization techniques, the IRON
              method offers several advantages. First, IRON normalization
              occurs pair-wise, thereby avoiding the need for all chips to be
              normalized together, which can be important for large data
              analyses. Secondly, the technique does not require similarity in
              signal distribution across chips for normalization, which can be
              important for maintaining biologically relevant differences in a
              heterogeneous background. Lastly, IRON introduces fewer
              post-processing artifacts, particularly in data whose behavior
              violates common assumptions. Thus, the IRON method provides a
              practical solution to common needs of expression analysis. A
              software implementation of IRON is available at
              [http://gene.moffitt.org/libaffy/].",

              expressed genes, yet translating these lists into key functional
              distinctions between species has proved difficult. Here we
              provide a more integrated view of human brain evolution by
              examining the large-scale organization of gene coexpression
              networks in human and chimpanzee brains. We identify modules of
              coexpressed genes that correspond to discrete brain regions and
              quantify their conservation between the species. Module
              conservation in cerebral cortex is significantly weaker than
              module conservation in subcortical brain regions, revealing a
              striking gradient that parallels known evolutionary hierarchies.
              We introduce a method for identifying species-specific network
              connections and demonstrate how differential network connectivity
              can be used to identify key drivers of evolutionary change. By

              of these samples has become routine in the plant research
              community, it is often hampered by a lack of metadata or
              differences in annotation styles of different labs. In this
              study, we carefully selected and integrated 6057 Arabidopsis
              microarray expression samples from 304 experiments deposited to
              the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) at the National Center for
              Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Metadata such as tissue type,
              growth conditions and developmental stage were manually curated

              of the integrated data set and found that samples of the same

  abstract = "SUMMARY: Hierarchical clustering is a widely used method for
              detecting clusters in genomic data. Clusters are defined by
              cutting branches off the dendrogram. A common but inflexible
              method uses a constant height cutoff value; this method exhibits
              suboptimal performance on complicated dendrograms. We present the
              Dynamic Tree Cut R package that implements novel dynamic branch
              cutting methods for detecting clusters in a dendrogram depending
              on their shape. Compared to the constant height cutoff method,
              our techniques offer the following advantages: (1) they are
              capable of identifying nested clusters; (2) they are
              flexible-cluster shape parameters can be tuned to suit the
              application at hand; (3) they are suitable for automation; and
              (4) they can optionally combine the advantages of hierarchical
              clustering and partitioning around medoids, giving better
              detection of outliers. We illustrate the use of these methods by
              applying them to protein-protein interaction network data and to
              a simulated gene expression data set. AVAILABILITY: The Dynamic

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Correlation networks are increasingly being used in
              bioinformatics applications. For example, weighted gene
              co-expression network analysis is a systems biology method for
              describing the correlation patterns among genes across microarray
              samples. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) can be
              used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes,
              for summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an
              intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to
              external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and
              for calculating module membership measures. Correlation networks
              facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used
              to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These
              methods have been successfully applied in various biological
              contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and
              analysis of brain imaging data. While parts of the correlation
              network methodology have been described in separate publications,
              there is a need to provide a user-friendly, comprehensive, and
              consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial.
              RESULTS: The WGCNA R software package is a comprehensive
              collection of R functions for performing various aspects of
              weighted correlation network analysis. The package includes
              functions for network construction, module detection, gene
              selection, calculations of topological properties, data
              simulation, visualization, and interfacing with external
              software. Along with the R package we also present R software
              tutorials. While the methods development was motivated by gene
              expression data, the underlying data mining approach can be
              applied to a variety of different settings. CONCLUSION: The WGCNA
              package provides R functions for weighted correlation network
              analysis, e.g. co-expression network analysis of gene expression
              data. The R package along with its source code and additional

              theoretical notions, such as clustering coefficient, network

              developed in order to characterize the structure of these

              their topological structure, but also in their dynamical
              capabilities. For this reason we aim to propose a pseudo-distance
              between networks, built around the notions of determination and

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: The goal of neighborhood analysis is to find a set of
              genes (the neighborhood) that is similar to an initial 'seed' set
              of genes. Neighborhood analysis methods for network data are
              important in systems biology. If individual network connections
              are susceptible to noise, it can be advantageous to define
              neighborhoods on the basis of a robust interconnectedness
              measure, e.g. the topological overlap measure. Since the use of
              multiple nodes in the seed set may lead to more informative
              neighborhoods, it can be advantageous to define multi-node
              similarity measures. RESULTS: The pairwise topological overlap
              measure is generalized to multiple network nodes and subsequently
              used in a recursive neighborhood construction method. A local
              permutation scheme is used to determine the neighborhood size.
              Using four network applications and a simulated example, we
              provide empirical evidence that the resulting neighborhoods are
              biologically meaningful, e.g. we use neighborhood analysis to
              identify brain cancer related genes. AVAILABILITY: An executable

              interactions of genes and/or proteins. Genes or proteins that are
              directly linked may have a similar biological function or may be
              part of the same biological pathway. Since the information on the
              connection (adjacency) between 2 nodes may be noisy or
              incomplete, it can be desirable to consider alternative measures
              of pairwise interconnectedness. Here we study a class of measures
              that are proportional to the number of neighbors that a pair of
              nodes share in common. For example, the topological overlap
              measure by Ravasz et al. [1] can be interpreted as a measure of
              agreement between the m = 1 step neighborhoods of 2 nodes.
              Several studies have shown that two proteins having a higher

  abstract = "Abstract Biomarker discovery is one of the major topics in
              translational biomedicine study based on high-throughput
              biological data analysis. Traditional methods focus on
              differentially expressed genes (or node-biomarkers) but ignore
              non-differentials. However, non-differentially expressed genes
              also play important roles in the biological processes and the
              rewired interactions / edges among non-differential genes may
              reveal fundamental difference between variable conditions.
              Therefore, it is necessary to identify relevant interactions or
              gene pairs to elucidate the molecular mechanism of complex
              biological phenomena, e.g. distinguish different phenotypes. To
              address this issue, we proposed a new method based on a new
              vector representation of an edge, EdgeMarker, to (1) identify
              edge-biomarkers, i.e. the differentially correlated molecular
              pairs (e.g., gene pairs) with optimal classification ability, and
              (2) transform the `node expression' data in node space into the
              `edge expression' data in edge space and classify the phenotype
              of each single sample in edge space, which generally cannot be
              achieved in traditional methods. Unlike the traditional methods
              which analyze the node space (i.e. molecular expression space) or
              higher dimensional space using arbitrary kernel methods, this
              study provides a mathematical model to explore the edge space
              (i.e. correlation space) for classification of a single sample.
              In this work, we show that the identified edge-biomarkers indeed
              have strong ability in distinguishing normal and disease samples
              even when all involved genes are not significantly differentially
              expressed. The analysis of human cholangiocarcinoma dataset and
              diabetes dataset also suggested that the identified

              system-level functionality of genes. The network construction is
              conceptually straightforward: nodes represent genes and nodes are
              connected if the corresponding genes are significantly
              co-expressed across appropriately chosen tissue samples. In
              reality, it is tricky to define the connections between the nodes

              biologically meaningful to encode gene co-expression using binary
              information (connected=1, unconnected=0). We describe a general
              framework for ;soft' thresholding that assigns a connection

              parameters of the adjacency function, we propose a biologically
              motivated criterion (referred to as the scale-free topology
              criterion). We generalize the following important network
              concepts to the case of weighted networks. First, we introduce
              several node connectivity measures and provide empirical evidence
              that they can be important for predicting the biological
              significance of a gene. Second, we provide theoretical and
              empirical evidence that the ;weighted' topological overlap
              measure (used to define gene modules) leads to more cohesive
              modules than its ;unweighted' counterpart. Third, we generalize
              the clustering coefficient to weighted networks. Unlike the
              unweighted clustering coefficient, the weighted clustering
              coefficient is not inversely related to the connectivity. We
              provide a model that shows how an inverse relationship between
              clustering coefficient and connectivity arises from hard
              thresholding. We apply our methods to simulated data, a cancer
              microarray data set, and a yeast microarray data set.",

               regulatory networks from mRNA expression data.Results: We
               present a new score for network inference, $\eta$2, that is
               derived from an analysis of variance. Candidate transcription
               factor:target gene (TF:TG) relationships are assumed more likely
               if the expression of TF and TG are mutually dependent in at
               least a subset of the examined experiments. We evaluate this
               dependency by $\eta$2, a non-parametric, non-linear correlation
               coefficient. It is fast, easy to apply and does not require the
               discretization of the input data. In the recent DREAM5 blind
               assessment, the arguably most comprehensive evaluation of
               inference methods, our approach based on $\eta$2 was rated the

               better than methods tested in other recently published

                   models that attempt to capture those interactions. These

                   samples to tease out subtle signals and infer connections
                   between genes (or gene products). The result is an aggregate

               Thus, estimating a condition-specific network from a single
               sample is crucial to elucidating the molecular mechanisms of
               complex diseases at the system level. However, there is

               allows us to construct individual-specific networks based on

               to understand disease mechanisms at the system level. A large
               number of algorithms have been developed to infer gene
               regulatory networks from gene-expression datasets. If you
               remember the success of IBM's Watson in ''Jeopardy!„ quiz show,
               the critical features of Watson were the use of very large
               numbers of heterogeneous algorithms generating various
               hypotheses and to select one of which as the answer. We took
               similar approach, ``TopkNet'', to see if ``Wisdom of Crowd''
               approach can be applied for network reconstruction. We
               discovered that ``Wisdom of Crowd'' is a powerful approach where
               integration of optimal algorithms for a given dataset can
               achieve better results than the best individual algorithm.
               However, such an analysis begs the question ``How to choose
               optimal algorithms for a given dataset?'' We found that
               similarity among gene-expression datasets is a key to select
               optimal algorithms, i.e., if dataset A for which optimal
               algorithms are known is similar to dataset B, the optimal
               algorithms for dataset A may be also optimal for dataset B.
               Thus, our ``TopkNet'' together with similarity measure among
               datasets can provide a powerful strategy towards harnessing

              categories, association of genes with regulatory pathways, and
              clustering of genes into modules that are potentially

              clustering methods such as hierarchical clustering or principal
              component analysis are difficult to deploy effectively for
              several of these tasks since genes rarely exhibit similar
              expression pattern across a wide range of conditions.
              Bi-clustering of gene expression data is a promising methodology
              for identification of gene groups that show a coherent expression

               are differentially-expressed in the samples in the bicluster
               compared to the samples not in the bicluster. In addition, we

               as batch effects can dramatically reduce the accuracy of
               statistical inference in genomic experiments. These sources of
               noise must be modeled and removed to accurately measure
               biological variability and to obtain correct statistical
               inference when performing high-throughput genomic analysis. We
               introduced surrogate variable analysis (sva) for estimating
               these artifacts by (i) identifying the part of the genomic data
               only affected by artifacts and (ii) estimating the artifacts
               with principal components or singular vectors of the subset of
               the data matrix. The resulting estimates of artifacts can be
               used in subsequent analyses as adjustment factors to correct
               analyses. Here I describe a version of the sva approach
               specifically created for count data or FPKMs from sequencing

                   expression data, where each network encodes relationships
                   between genes that are locally co-regulated by shared

  abstract  = "Background Accumulated biological research outcomes show that
               biological functions do not depend on individual genes, but on
               complex gene networks. Microarray data are widely used to
               cluster genes according to their expression levels across
               experimental conditions. However, functionally related genes
               generally do not show coherent expression across all conditions
               since any given cellular process is active only under a subset
               of conditions. Biclustering finds gene clusters that have
               similar expression levels across a subset of conditions. This
               paper proposes a seed-based algorithm that identifies coherent
               genes in an exhaustive, but efficient manner. Methods In order
               to find the biclusters in a gene expression dataset, we
               exhaustively select combinations of genes and conditions as
               seeds to create candidate bicluster tables. The tables have two
               columns (a) a gene set, and (b) the conditions on which the gene
               set have dissimilar expression levels to the seed. First, the
               genes with less than the maximum number of dissimilar conditions
               are identified and a table of these genes is created. Second,
               the rows that have the same dissimilar conditions are grouped
               together. Third, the table is sorted in ascending order based on
               the number of dissimilar conditions. Finally, beginning with the
               first row of the table, a test is run repeatedly to determine
               whether the cardinality of the gene set in the row is greater
               than the minimum threshold number of genes in a bicluster. If
               so, a bicluster is outputted and the corresponding row is
               removed from the table. Repeating this process, all biclusters
               in the table are systematically identified until the table
               becomes empty. Conclusions This paper presents a novel
               biclustering algorithm for the identification of additive
               biclusters. Since it involves exhaustively testing combinations
               of genes and conditions, the additive biclusters can be found
               more readily.",

              Most of biclustering approaches use a measure or cost function

  abstract  = "DNA microarray technologies are used extensively to profile the
               expression levels of thousands of genes under various
               conditions, yielding extremely large data-matrices. Thus,
               analyzing this information and extracting biologically relevant
               knowledge becomes a considerable challenge. A classical approach
               for tackling this challenge is to use clustering (also known as
               one-way clustering) methods where genes (or respectively
               samples) are grouped together based on the similarity of their
               expression profiles across the set of all samples (or
               respectively genes). An alternative approach is to develop
               biclustering methods to identify local patterns in the data.
               These methods extract subgroups of genes that are co-expressed
               across only a subset of samples and may feature important
               biological or medical implications. In this study we evaluate 13
               biclustering and 2 clustering (k-means and hierarchical)
               methods. We use several approaches to compare their performance
               on two real gene expression data sets. For this purpose we apply
               four evaluation measures in our analysis: (1) we examine how
               well the considered (bi)clustering methods differentiate various
               sample types; (2) we evaluate how well the groups of genes
               discovered by the (bi)clustering methods are annotated with
               similar Gene Ontology categories; (3) we evaluate the capability
               of the methods to differentiate genes that are known to be
               specific to the particular sample types we study and (4) we
               compare the running time of the algorithms. In the end, we
               conclude that as long as the samples are well defined and
               annotated, the contamination of the samples is limited, and the
               samples are well replicated, biclustering methods such as Plaid

              organisms, enabling us to better understand the molecular basis
              of disease and important traits. Correlation approaches, such as
              a hierarchical cluster analysis, have been widely used to analyze
              omics data. In addition to the changes in the mean levels of
              molecules in the omics data, it is important to know about the
              changes in the correlation relationship among molecules between 2
              experimental conditions. The development of a tool to identify
              differential correlation patterns in omics data in an efficient
              and unbiased manner is therefore desirable. We developed the
              DiffCorr package, a simple method for identifying pattern changes
              between 2 experimental conditions in correlation networks, which
              builds on a commonly used association measure, such as Pearson's
              correlation coefficient. DiffCorr calculates correlation matrices
              for each dataset, identifies the first principal component-based
              ``eigen-molecules'' in the correlation networks, and tests
              differential correlation between the 2 groups based on Fisher's
              z-test. We illustrated its utility by demonstrating biologically
              relevant, differentially correlated molecules in transcriptome
              coexpression and metabolite-to-metabolite correlation networks.
              DiffCorr can explore differential correlations between 2
              conditions in the context of post-genomics data types, namely
              transcriptomics and metabolomics. DiffCorr is simple to use in

              many samples, require analytic tools to reduce their complexity.
              The Iterative Signature Algorithm (ISA) is a biclustering
              algorithm. It was designed to decompose a large set of data into
              so-called 'modules'. In the context of gene expression data,
              these modules consist of subsets of genes that exhibit a coherent
              expression profile only over a subset of microarray experiments.
              Genes and arrays may be attributed to multiple modules and the
              level of required coherence can be varied resulting in different
              'resolutions' of the modular mapping. In this short note, we
              introduce two BioConductor software packages written in GNU R:
              The isa2 package includes an optimized implementation of the ISA
              and the eisa package provides a convenient interface to run the
              ISA, visualize its output and put the biclusters into biological
              context. Potential users of these packages are all R and

              particular tissue or condition is a problem that cannot be solved
              by standard statistical testing procedures. A relatively unknown
              procedure that can be used is the intersection-union test (IUT).
              However, two disadvantages of the IUT are that it is conservative
              and it conveys only the information of the least differing target
              tissue-other tissue pair. RESULTS: We propose a Bayesian
              procedure that quantifies how much evidence there is in the
              overall expression profile for selective over-expression. In a
              small simulation study, it is shown that the proposed method
              outperforms the IUT when it comes to finding selectively
              expressed genes. An application to publicly available data
              consisting of 22 tissues shows that the Bayesian method indeed
              selects genes with functions that reflect the specific tissue

  abstract  = "Background Co-occurrence analysis is a technique often applied
               in text mining, comparative genomics, and promoter analysis. The
               methodologies and statistical models used to evaluate the
               significance of association between co-occurring entities are
               quite diverse, however. Methodology/Principal Findings We
               present a general framework for co-occurrence analysis based on
               a bipartite graph representation of the data, a novel
               co-occurrence statistic, and software performing co-occurrence
               analysis as well as generation and analysis of co-occurrence
               networks. We show that the overall stringency of co-occurrence
               analysis depends critically on the choice of the null-model used
               to evaluate the significance of co-occurrence and find that
               random sampling from a complete permutation set of the bipartite
               graph permits co-occurrence analysis with optimal stringency. We
               show that the Poisson-binomial distribution is the most natural
               co-occurrence probability distribution when vertex degrees of
               the bipartite graph are variable, which is usually the case.
               Calculation of Poisson-binomial P-values is difficult, however.
               Therefore, we propose a fast bi-binomial approximation for
               calculation of P-values and show that this statistic is superior
               to other measures of association such as the Jaccard coefficient
               and the uncertainty coefficient. Furthermore, co-occurrence
               analysis of more than two entities can be performed using the
               same statistical model, which leads to increased signal-to-noise
               ratios, robustness towards noise, and the identification of
               implicit relationships between co-occurring entities. Using
               NetCutter, we identify a novel protein biosynthesis related set
               of genes that are frequently coordinately deregulated in human
               cancer related gene expression studies. NetCutter is available
               at http://bio.ifom-ieo-campus.it/NetCutter/). Conclusion Our
               approach can be applied to any set of categorical data where
               co-occurrence analysis might reveal functional relationships
               such as clinical parameters associated with cancer subtypes or
               SNPs associated with disease phenotypes. The stringency of our
               approach is expected to offer an advantage in a variety of

               that genes with co-occurring mutations prefer direct signaling
               transductions and that the interaction relations among cancer
               genes in the network are related with their functional
               similarity. It was also revealed that genes with co-occurring

              exist and offer the ability to adjust for covariates (e.g. batch

              them, which in contrast to previous work explicitly uses
              intron-exon structure in parent genes to classify pseudogenes. We
              require alignments between duplicated pseudogenes and their
              parents to span intron-exon junctions, and this can be used to
              distinguish between true duplicated and processed pseudogenes
              (with insertions). RESULTS: Applying our approach to the ENCODE
              regions, we identify about 160 pseudogenes, 10\% of which have
              clear 'intron-exon' structure and are thus likely generated from
              recent duplications. CONCLUSION: Detailed examination of our
              results and comparison of our annotation with the GENCODE

               uncover biological insights. Most microarray experiments profile
               whole tissues containing mixtures of multiple cell-types. As
               such, gene expression differences between samples may be due to
               different cellular compositions or biological differences,
               highly limiting the conclusions derived from the analysis. All
               current approaches to computationally separate the heterogeneous
               gene expression to individual cell-types require that the
               identity, relative amount of the cell-types in the tissue or
               their individual gene expression are known. Publically available
               microarray-based datasets, which include thousands of patient
               samples, do not usually measure this information, rendering
               existing separation methods unusable. We developed a novel
               approach to estimate the number of cell-types, identities,
               individual gene expression and relative proportions in
               heterogeneous tissues with no a-priori information except for an
               initial estimate of the cell-types in the tissue analyzed and
               general reference signatures of these cell-types that may be

              cell or tissue types, in varying proportions, each contributing
              to global gene expression. This heterogeneity is a major
              confounder in standard analysis such as differential expression

              Predicting cell-type--specific expression in mammals has been
              hindered by the oftentimes unknown location of distal regulatory
              regions. To alleviate this bottleneck, we used DNase-seq data
              from 19 diverse human cell types to identify proximal and distal
              regulatory elements at genome-wide scale. Matched expression data
              allowed us to separate genes into classes of cell-type--specific
              up-regulated, down-regulated, and constitutively expressed genes.
              CG dinucleotide content and DNA accessibility in the promoters of
              these three classes of genes displayed substantial differences,
              highlighting the importance of including these aspects in
              modeling gene expression. We associated DNase I hypersensitive
              sites (DHSs) with genes, and trained classifiers for different
              expression patterns. TF sequence motif matches in DHSs provided a

              mostly in the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) of viral mRNA. BYDV,
              which lacks both a cap and poly(A) tail, has a CITE (called BTE)
              present in its 3′UTR that is essential for efficient translation

              translation initiation is not understood.Using fluorescence
              anisotropy and gel mobility shift assays we demonstrated that the
              40S ribosome has moderate binding affinity to the 3′ UTR

              According to microautoradiography an irreversibly bound residue
