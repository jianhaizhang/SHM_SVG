# spatialHeatmap aSVG Repository

This SVG repository is used to deposit annotated SVGs (aSVGs) made by the [spatialHeatmap](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/spatialHeatmap.html) users. The instructions for creating custom aSVGs are provided in the [SVG tutorial](https://jianhaizhang.github.io/SHM_SVG).  

Guidelines to deposit aSVGs:
 
1. Make a subfolder in `SHM_SVG_repo`, e.g. `UCR`.  

2. In the new subfolder made above, deposit aSVGs and include a `README.md` file with author(s) information, citation format, etc.
